You should see a new Jupyter notebook open. You'll need to wait for a few minutes while Studio launches an instance in the backend to run the notebook. This step should take less than 3 mins

After a few mins, you can see the status of the notebook, at the top of the notebook, or by clicking on the verticle menu bar on the left.

You are now ready to start running code in the Jupyter notebook cells.
