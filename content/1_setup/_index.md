In this section you'll learn how to setup Amazon SageMaker Studio.

SageMaker Studio provides a single, web-based visual interface where you can perform all ML development steps. With SageMaker Studio, you get complete access, control, and visibility into each step required to build, train, and deploy models. You can quickly upload data, create new notebooks, train and tune models, move back and forth between steps to adjust experiments, compare results, and deploy models to production all in one place. All ML development activities including notebooks, experiment management, automatic model creation, debugging, and model and data drift detection can be performed within SageMaker Studio.
