#### In this section you'll learn how to build train and tune your machine learning models.

#### You will cover:

1. Preparing your training, validation and test Sets
1. Training a model using XGBoost on [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/?trk=el_a134p000006vgXgAAI&trkCampaign=NA-FY21-GC-400-FTSA-SAG-Overview&sc_channel=el&sc_campaign=Y21-SageMaker_shshnkp&sc_outcome=AIML_Digital_Marketing)
1. Using [Amazon SageMaker Debugger](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/debugger/?trk=el_a134p000006vgXgAAI&trkCampaign=NA-FY21-GC-400-FTSA-SAG-Overview&sc_channel=el&sc_campaign=Y21-SageMaker_shshnkp&sc_outcome=AIML_Digital_Marketing) to debug and profile your training jobs
1. Generate bias reports using [Amazon SageMaker Clarify](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/clarify/?trk=el_a134p000006vgXgAAI&trkCampaign=NA-FY21-GC-400-FTSA-SAG-Overview&sc_channel=el&sc_campaign=Y21-SageMaker_shshnkp&sc_outcome=AIML_Digital_Marketing)
1. Track model lineage with built-in Amazon SageMake Lineage tracking
1. Saving models and lineage information in the SageMaker Model registry
