Welcome to the Getting Started with Amazon SageMaker workshop. Amazon SageMaker helps data scientists and developers to prepare, build, train, and deploy high-quality machine learning (ML) models quickly by bringing together a broad set of capabilities purpose-built for ML.

In this workshop you'll learn how to:

* Analyze and prepare data using SageMaker Studio
* Build train and tune ML models using AutoPilot and Built-in algorithms
  * SageMaker AutoPilot: Use AutoML to build, train and tune the best ML models with SageMaker Autopilot
  * SageMaker Built-in: Use XGBoost in SageMaker to build, and train ML models
* Detect bias in ML models using Amazon SageMaker Clarify
* Deploy ML models for realtime and offline batch predictions
